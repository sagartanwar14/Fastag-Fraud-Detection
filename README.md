# FASTag Fraud Detection

## Description
Dataset is obtained fron Kaggle.
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in the FASTag electronic toll collection system. 
The goal is to analyze transaction data and identify potential fraud using machine learning techniques.

## Installation

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or manually install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fastag-fraud-detection.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

## Dataset

The dataset contains transactional data, including:

- Transaction ID
- Vehicle Number
- Timestamp
- Amount
- Location
- Other relevant details

Ensure the dataset is placed in the appropriate directory before running the notebook.

## Model and Approach

The project uses machine learning techniques to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. Common techniques include:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model selection and training (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Results

The model is evaluated based on its ability to accurately detect fraudulent transactions. Visualization techniques are used to understand the results and refine the model.
